title: Input latency and framerate
---

The Faulty Equipment Blog has a [great little summary look](http://blog.faulty.equipment/post/85541424684/a-look-at-input-latency-and-framerate) at the relationship between hardware and software in the whole response chain in gaming. It's worth a read, and I can say I've definitely noticed a difference from switching from a 8ms response time monitor to 1ms one; that switch also let me turn off v-sync which *really* improved the sensation of input responsiveness in gaming. Eyes and brains are bizarre things.
